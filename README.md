# WebGL-Physics
Practice with WebGL

Created this visualiztion as a group project for a course at UCSC, my personal contributions included the from-scratch physics system for manipulating spheres, and some work on the lighting effects. Hosted here: https://people.ucsc.edu/~tdyer/OpenGL_Physics_Project/driver.html
