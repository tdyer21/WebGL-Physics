How to interact:
'c' creates spheres that act according to physics in the first scene. 
'v' deletes the last sphere created 
'b' creates bouyant spheres that act with simulated under water physics.

Planning Document
</br>
    For our project weâ€™re planning to create an interactive information display for a product (maybe ourselves). 
    We want to move the user from 3d scene to 3d scene by moving the camera to different scenes in a 3d world 
    or rendering new ones, with the user having the ability to create and destroy objects within the scene. 
    Within each scene we plan to exhibit a host of various effects and user interactions. We plan to have different text 
    in each scene with a clickable hud for navigation. The HUD could be a shape or just a < > html text to navigate from 
    one scene to the next. To navigate we plan to use animation with keyframing. We are going for a clean and simple aesthetic
    with warm colors, low poly object designs, and soft lighting. We want the experience to feel friendly and approachable. 
    Project Quantum is designed to fluidly move users between 3d scenes to help improve the users understanding of a
    product or idea.  

  </br>
Description of each of (team members x2) advanced methods you have implemented.
	Interactive HUD: We are going to use this for navigation. There can be a markers or buttons to click to get from 
    one screen to the next. We will be able to use this to make sure the user can get around the project.
  Text onto objects: We wanted to show how to do the interactions we created so we put text on the walls to 
  show how to do everything.
  Collision Detection: We added collision detection using our own math, against the wall and the ceilings and floors.
  Object Physics (gravity + friction): We simulated acceleration due to gravity to create semi-realistic physics for bouncing spheres, and friction 
  so that the spheres eventually stop rolling. (done without the use of any outside library, built from scratch).
  Under water Physics: simulated spheres with bouyancy in the second scene. 
  Color Picking: We made it so you can choose the color of the objects.
  KeyFraming: Moving the camera using keys insead and zooming around.
  </br>
For the scenes our to do list is as follows:
 -were going to have limit camera movement to be closely around our scene.
 -add click and drag interactions
 	- add smoke and other visual effects mentioned about
	- add a hud for easy starting animations
	-make scene from OBJ and WebGL shapes
	-add shadows to your shaders
	-possibly add collision and maybe raytracing foreground/background if we get There
  -possibly add a few light sources for a richer lighting environment
</br>
For animations
	-possibly change from animating camera to animating scene to avoid having to animate light sources as well
	-index fading from and to scenes with deletion after complete fade on scene exhibit
	-Already implemented linear interpolation for animations
	-render new scene on start of a transition
	-make class to handle this???
	-possibly add effects or change background color
	
    </br>
    
How to interact with our creation:
	X will shift the camera to a viewing angle for the next scene. C will create the shapes included in a given scene. 
    T will terminate all of the objects in the current scene. You can look around with the mouse.
